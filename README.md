# Snake GB

An homebrew implementation of the classic Snake game for Nintendo Game Boy, a.k.a. "DMG". Written by [tomas7770](https://github.com/tomas7770) in C, using the GBDK-2020 API.

Tested on BGB 1.5.9 emulator, not tested on real hardware.

**High scores do not save and are lost upon reset.**

## Build instructions

This is system dependent, but the following instructions should apply:

1. Download/install a recent version of [GBDK-2020](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020)

2. Use **lcc** to compile all \*.c source files. No special flags are required.

3. You should now have a ROM file that can run on a Game Boy or any compatible emulator.
